	Each service may cover one or more area on map. For simplicity we
	consider them to be rectangular. Each area can be also seen as a
	view for dispatcher's map, if the map has a swtich that allows
	"jumping" between views.

	To represent an area we need four parameters: min and max latitude
	and longitude. We also add a center latitude and longitude which
	is not necessary but will spare repeated center calculation. Also
	this way the center might be shifted, if there's ever need for this.
